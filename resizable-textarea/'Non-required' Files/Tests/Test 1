/*

Extension has loaded successfully
-Issue - had to rename the manifest file as I had made a typo.
    -Extension loaded fine once fixed

Test 1:
To test your extension, open Microsoft Edge Dev, go to edge://extensions, enable "Developer mode" (toggle switch in the bottom-left corner), click on "Load unpacked," and select the resizable-textarea folder you created earlier.

Result 1: PASS
-Extension loads OK
-Clicking the icon activates the extension OK
-Resizing text input box horizontally OK
-Resizing text input box vertically after resizing horizontally OK

Bug
-Little thing that you grab to resize the text input area doesn't 'stick' to the right place at the edge of the input box, it sort of sticks in the middle if you make the input box larger
    -Doesn't dynamically move based on the size of the input Box
